### 𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞
I have developed multiple microservices and created event-driven architecture from scratch and the diagram is already attached here where I have used the spring cloud stack and applications always provide

- ⭐ High Availability
- ⭐ High Concurrency
- ⭐ High Visibility
- ⭐ Everything must be in the code base. Every configuration must be in the codebase. It may be a database script or configuration.
- ⭐ Hassle-free release cycle (One-click release without service interruption) due to event-driven architecture
- ⭐ Microservice Architecture
- ⭐ Normalized database design
- ⭐ One database with multiple schema design

#### Backend:
I have developed multiple microservices using the below technology stack

- ✔️ Java
- ✔️ Spring boot Microservices Architecture
- ✔️ Spring boot ZUUL gateway
- ✔️ Spring JWT Token-based Security
- ✔️ Eureka registry server
- ✔️ Spring cloud-config
- ✔️ Spring Data JPA
- ✔️ Event-driven Architecture
- ✔️ Hazelcast Spring caching
- ✔️ Hazelcast 2nd level caching
- ✔️ Kafka (For event-driven and to manage back pressure)
- ✔️ MQTT
- ✔️ Normalized database design
- ✔️ One database with multiple schema design due to microservices architecture
- ✔️ High Availability
- ✔️ High Concurrency
- ✔️ Zero configuration on the release cycle. Every configuration must be in the codebase.
- ✔️ Hassle-free release cycle (One-click release without service interruption)

#### DevOps
I have provided a full-proof DevOps solution where Zero downtime while releasing product features. I have implemented a one-click release process using AWS CI/CD and bitbucket hooks.

- ✔️ Aws Code deploy/ Code pipeline (Integrated bitbucket for hassle-free one-click deployment)
- ✔️ Dockerization of Java microservices (Build once and run everywhere)
- ✔️ Kubernetes
- ✔️ helm chart
- ✔️ AWS EC2
- ✔️ API Gateway
- ✔️ AWS CI/CD Code build/pipeline
- ✔️ AWS lambda (Automated deployment using lambda)
- ✔️ ECS Fargate (Deployed all microservices)
- ✔️ AWS S3
- ✔️ AWS SQS, SNS
- ✔️ AWS SFTP
- ✔️ EKS (Deployed haproxy, Nginx, cratedb, Kafka, Flink, zookeeper, MQTT broker)
- ✔️ Lambda
- ✔️ CloudMap
- ✔️ CloudWatch
- ✔️ Grafana Dashboard
- ✔️ Prometheus Metrics
- ✔️ Kafka
- ✔️ MQTT
- ✔️ Terraform
- ✔️ Cloudformation

#### Flink
I deployed the below components in the Kubernetes cluster.

- ✔️ Zookeeper
- ✔️ Kafka
- ✔️ Job manager
- ✔️ task manager
- ✔️ Flink jobs

#### About Flink work,
I have developed a "Volume/TIme Wifi Quota Management system" using Flink where I need to continiously calculate user's internet quota. where access point continiously send events to cloud controller and controller will pass events to Flink. For more details about this project you can find in my portfolio.

#### Using Flink
1. I had developed session gap window
2. I had used it's queryable functionality to check current state of user's quota
3. I had used Flink's core process function and implemented own session gap window due to limitation of flink.
4. Used Flink's accumulator and many more things


#### Kafka
- ✔️ Kafka docker deployment 
- ✔️ Kafka Kubernetes deployment
- ✔️ Kafka Helm deployment
- ✔️ Spring boot integration

#### MQTT
- ✔️ End to end certificate-based encryption
- ✔️ MQTT broker webhook development
- ✔️ MQTT broker management
- ✔️ MQTT topic shared subscription
- ✔️ MQTT proxy listener
- ✔️ MQTT broker autoscaling on Kubernetes
- ✔️ MQTT Cluster


#### IOT
- ✔️ IOT implementation based on MQTT protocol
- ✔️ IOT device management, Firmware/OTA management
- ✔️ IOT device certificate-based security, certificate management

#### Monitoring Tools
- ✔️ Prometheus 
- ✔️ Grafana
